## Running the code ðŸš‚ <a name="running-code"></a>

If you want to run the dashboard from source, clone it and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/alesanmed-educational-projects/core-data-covid-project.git

cd core-data-covid-project/dashboard
```

### Installation ðŸŽ¢ <a name="installing"></a>

First, install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if you use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```
poetry install
```

### Configuration âš™ <a name="configuring"></a>

The project looks for the following environment variables to configure several parts:

- BACK_URL: URL de la API de flask

### Execution ðŸŽ¯ <a name="running"></a>

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can bring the dashboard up:

```
streamlit run app/main.py
```

## Pages <a name="pages"></a>

### General data <a name="general-data"></a>

This page shows general COVID data. You can find global cases, global charts as well as a map with rates per country.

You can also filter the data by countries and types, as well as the chart type.

### Country data <a name="country-data"></a>

This page is a per-country detailed page. It splits the data by provinces (states). You can export that page to PDF and also send it via email.

Again, you can filter by provinces, case type, and chart type.

### Manage data <a name="manage-data"></a>

This page allows creating new countries using an API key. The created data should be available right away in the dashboard.
